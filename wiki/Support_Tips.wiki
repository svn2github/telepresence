==1. Lowering CPU==
===1.1 Avoid audio resampling===
To avoid audio resampling, the SIP clients connecting to a bridge have to use a codec with the sample rate, channels and bits per sample as the [Technical_Audio_mixer_design "pivot settings"]. For more information, check section [Technical_Audio_mixer_design here]. <br />
*tip:* In you configuration file, enable codecs with same settings as the pivot.

===1.2 Only record sessions if needed===
Do not enable recording if itâ€™s not important to you or use `*`.avi container which consume less CPU than `*`.mp4 (because of AAC encoder from [Support_BuildingSourceCode#Building_libfaac libfaac]).

===1.3 Use common video codec===
All SIP clients with the same video codec will share a single encoder. Try to use common video codec for all clients. For example, if you have two clients, A and B, with A supporting both H.264 and VP8 and B only H.264 then, you should make sure that A will offer H.264 with highest priority. For more information, check [Technical_Video_mixer_design#Encoders_and_decoders here]. <br />
*tip:* In your configuration file, enable a single video codec if you cannot control the SIP clients.

===1.4 Use 2d audio mixing===
Enable 2D audio mixing instead of 3D.

===1.5 Lower mixed video size and fps===
If you have a weak CPU then, consider using a reasonable video size (e.g. VGA) and fps ([15 - 30]).
