==1. Lowering CPU==
===1.1 Avoid audio resampling===
To avoid audio resampling, the SIP clients connecting to a bridge have to use a codec with the sample rate, channels and bits per sample as the [Technical_Audio_mixer_design "pivot settings"]. For more information, check [Technical_Audio_mixer_design here]. <br />
<u>*tip:*</u> In you configuration file, enable codecs with same settings as the pivot.

===1.2 Only record sessions if needed===
Do not enable recording if itâ€™s not important to you or use `*`.avi container which consume less CPU than `*`.mp4 (because of AAC encoder from [Support_BuildingSourceCode#Building_libfaac libfaac]).

===1.3 Use common video codec===
All SIP clients with the same video codec will share a single encoder. Try to use common video codec for all clients. For example, if you have two clients, A and B, with A supporting both H.264 and VP8 and B only H.264 then, you should make sure that A will offer H.264 with highest priority. For more information, check [Technical_Video_mixer_design#Encoders_and_decoders here]. <br />
<u>*tip:*</u> In your configuration file, enable a single video codec if you cannot control the SIP clients.

===1.4 Use 2d audio mixing===
Enable 2D audio mixing instead of 3D.

===1.5 Lower mixed video size and fps===
If you have a weak CPU then, consider using a reasonable video size (e.g. VGA) and fps ([15 - 30]).

===1.5 Multi-threading and ASM===
Make sure to enable [Support_BuildingSourceCode#Building_YASM YASM] and pthread when building [Support_BuildingSourceCode#Building_FFmpeg FFmpeg], [Support_BuildingSourceCode#Building_x264 x264] and [Support_BuildingSourceCode#Building_libvpx VP8].

==2. Lowering bandwidth==
 * 	Use "slow" motion rank (see [Configuration_Video#Bandwidth_and_congestion_control here])
 *	Use small mixed video size (see [Configuration_Video#Output_mixed_size here])
 *	Set the maximum upload and download bandwidth (see [Configuration_Video#Bandwidth_and_congestion_control here])
 *	Use small video frame rate (see [Configuration_Video#Bandwidth_and_congestion_control here])

<u>*tip:*</u> To test your available bandwidth, we recommend http://www.speedtest.net/. <br />
<u>*tip:*</u> To check bandwidth usage, we recommend iftop.

==3. Improving audio quality==
 *	Use [Support_BuildingSourceCode#Building_libopus Opus] (or G.722) audio codec if supported by the SIP clients (see [Configuration_Audio_Video_codecs here]).
 *	Avoid audio up-sampling and down-sampling (see [Technical_Audio_mixer_design here]).
 *	If the [Technical_Audio_mixer_design "pivot settings"] use a sample rate (SR) equal to S then, try to use codecs with a SR equal to "S << n" or "S >> n".

==4. Improving video quality==
 * Use Google Chrome as SIP client (check our WebRTC demo client at [http://conf-call.org/ http://conf-call.org/]).
 * Enable "Zero-Artifacts" feature (see [Technical_Video_quality#Zero-artifacts here] and [Configuration_Video#Zero-artifacts here])
 * Use a client supporting something close to 16/9 video size to avoid stretching issues
 * Avoid video up-sampling and down-sampling

==5. Lowering recorded video file size==
