_Configuration 10: Recording conference to a file_

 * *record* - whether to record the sessions.
 * *record-file-ext* - defines the container to use. Almost any container (<u>avi</u>, <u>mp4</u>, <u>webm</u>, <u>mkv</u> â€¦) could be used but this depends on how you built FFmpeg. For more technical information, please check [Technical_Recording_conference_to_a_file here].
We highly recommend using [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html VLC] to play the output file.
