This is a short list with all *known issues* (to be fixed before the end of the beta phase).
 # The audio quality on the recorded files is not as good as we expect. This looks like an issue on the PTS and DTS.
 # Sometimes, the recorded file cannot be played.
 # Mixed video looks stretched when the SIP clients is a mobile in portrait (e.g. iDoubs and IMSDroid). No issue when device is in landscape or using our WebRTC demo client.

 # Mixer fails to negotiate H.263
