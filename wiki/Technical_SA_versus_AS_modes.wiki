#summary [Technical details] SA versus AS modes
#labels Featured,Phase-Design

The server supports two modes: *SA* (<u>s</u>tand-<u>a</u>lone) and *AS* (<u>a</u>pplication <u>s</u>erver). These modes are not exclusive and no special configuration is needed.

The *SA* mode allows any SIP client to directly connect to the system without any intermediate node. If the client requires to be registered then, you can enable this option as explained [Configuration_SIP_registration here] because the SIP registrar mode is OFF by default.

The *AS* mode is useful if you already have your own SIP network/server and want to integrate the Telepresence system as an application server. This mode has been tested against [http://www.asterisk.org/ Asterisk], [http://www.resiprocate.org/Main_Page reSIProcate], [http://www.opensips.org/ openSIPS] and [http://www.kamailio.org/w/ Kamailio]. This is as easy as forwarding any INVITE (based on some criterias, e.g. _[domain name equal to @conf-call.org]_) received by the SIP registrar to the Telepresence system.
