This section explains how to secure both signaling and media plans.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

=Signaling=
Two secure signaling protocols are supported: *TLS* and *WSS*. *WSS* is WebSocket secured using *TLS*. For more information on how to enable these transport protocols using the configuration file, please refer to [Configuration_SIP_network_transports this wiki page]. 

Both transports require [https://code.google.com/p/telepresence/wiki/Support_BuildingSourceCode#Building_OpenSSL OpenSSL] which have to be enabled when building the Doubango framework only. 

More information on how to configure the SSL certificates could be found [Configuration_Security here].

=Media=
Both *SRTP-SDES* ([http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4568 RFC 4568]) and *SRTP-DTLS* ([http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5763 RFC 5763], [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5764 RFC 5764]) are supported. Check [Configuration_Security here] for more information on how these features have to be configured.
