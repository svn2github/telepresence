_Configuration 11: Audio settings_

 * *audio-channels* - number of audio channels to use. Supported values are <u>1</u> and <u>2</u>.
 * *audio-bits-per-sample* - number of bits for each audio sample. Supported values are <u>8</u>, <u>16</u> and <u>32</u>.
 * *audio-sample-rate*: - audio sample rate. Almost any value is supported: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_rate. Unit: Hz.
 * *audio-ptime* - number of milliseconds for each audio frame. The value should be multiple of 10. Supported values: <u>`[`1 - 255`]`</u>
 * *audio-volume* - attenuation (or gain) to apply to the mixed audio. Supported values: <u>`[`0.0f - 1.0f`]`</u>.
 * *audio-dim* - mixer dimensions. The value must be <u>2d</u> (Linear) or <u>3d</u> (Spatial). <u>3d</u> requires building the system with [Support_BuildingSourceCode#Building_OpenAL_Soft OpenAL Soft].
 * *audio-max-latecncy* - maximum audio delay (because of clock drift) before resetting the jitter buffer. The value could be any positive value. Unit: milliseconds.
