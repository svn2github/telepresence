#summary [Technical details] Bandwidth management and congestion control
#labels Featured,Phase-Design

In this current beta version we only focus on video bandwidth.

The upload and download video bandwidth settings have to be defined using the configuration file as explained at 6.11.1. The maximum download bandwidth is signaled to the remote endpoints using the SDP (b=AS:X attribute as per RFC [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3556 3556]) and *RTCP-REMB* packets (as per [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-alvestrand-rmcat-remb-02 draft-alvestrand-rmcat-remb-02]). In this beta version, *RTCP-TMMBN* ([http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5104 RFC 5104]) packets are deserialized but not processed by the system. 

The congestion control manager could be enabled using the configuration file as per section 6.11.1. In this beta version, [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-alvestrand-rtcweb-congestion-03 draft-alvestrand-rtcweb-congestion-03] is not fully implemented yet and weâ€™re using our own algorithms to compute the bandwidth usage. The computed maximum bandwidth (periodically) when the congestion control is enabled will never be higher than the maximum allowed values defined in your configuration file (this is kind of safe guard).
